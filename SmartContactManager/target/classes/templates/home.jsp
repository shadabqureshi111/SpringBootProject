			<p>Smart Cities Mission was launched by the Hon’ Prime Minister
				on 25 June, 2015. The main objective of the Mission is to promote
				cities that provide core infrastructure, clean and sustainable
				environment and give a decent quality of life to their citizens
				through the application of ‘smart solutions’. The Mission aims to
				drive economic growth and improve quality of life through
				comprehensive work on social, economic, physical and institutional
				pillars of the city. The focus is on sustainable and inclusive
				development by creation of replicable models which act as
				lighthouses to other aspiring cities. 100 cities have been selected
				to be developed as Smart Cities through a two-stage competition.
